# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression outpreformed the decision tree
- Changing the threshold to .04 increased recall from 99.3% to 100% (saving 7% more lives)
- The tradeoff with lowering the threshold is that precision decreased from 75% to 5% (5% more poeple were unnecessarily admitted)

# Web Pages
- Home page has a form to fill out
- The results page is a prediction of the parameters that were input
{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

# Development Environment

- **Google Colab**
-   Pandas
-   Scikit-learn
-   seaborn
-   numpy
-  **VScode**
-   Django framework
-   Some HTML
-   Vertual Environment

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Hoast on Heroku
* Clean up the front end and make it look better
